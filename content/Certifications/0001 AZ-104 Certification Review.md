## Introduction

I'm currently working as Azure Administrator and Office 365 Administrator on daily basis therefore recently I decided to pursue the [Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/husenjan/credentials/f5d62077c174a42f) certification. In this blog post, I will share my insights and experience  with studying and taking the exam with the hope that it will assist you with your journey.

## Preparation

First, I read through the [Microsoft Learn: Azure Associate Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-104/) course and while going through the course I took notes and deployed the Azure resources in my personal environment to enhance my understanding. Here's a brief overview of topics covered in the course:

* Virtual Machines
* Virtual Network
* Network Security Group
* Web App Service
* Containers
* Load Balancers
* Application Gateway
* Service Endpoints
* Recovery Site Vault
* Storage Accounts
* Azure Backups

After completing the course materials I decided to expand my understanding by watching videos from [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru/courses/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-certification-prep) and while going through the videos I also did the hands-on-labs challenges. Once the course materials were completed, I choose to memorize the different Azure resources by using spaced repetition.

## Exam

I'm usually nervous when I'm going to take a exam since I always feel as I know nothing compared to others. However, once the exam started I became more confident and the exam felt easy including the case study and the multiple of choices. After completing the multiple of choice questions and case study I choose to review the multiple of choice questions again to ensure I was confident with my choices, and after completing the review I delivered in the exam and saw a passing score of 737 of 1000.

I felt extremely happy that I successfully managed to pass the [Azure Administrator Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/husenjan/credentials/63db89b5064d17ff) certification. I still have a long way to go as I'm aiming to obtain [[0002 AZ-500 Certification Review|AZ-500]], [[0003 AZ-305 Certification Review|AZ-305]], [[0004 MD-102 Certification Review|MD-102]], [[0005 MS-102 Certification Review|MS-102]] certifications in 2024.
