## Introduction

About two years ago I made myself a promise to obtain following certifications AZ-900, MS-900, SC-900, OSCP, AZ-500, AZ-104, AZ-305, and MS-102 to increase my knowledge about cloud technologies and cyber security. I’m happy to inform that I successfully passed the Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert certification on 3rd September of 2024. In this post, I'll share my experience with studying and taking the [Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert (MS-102)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/husenjan/credentials/f6b075b311d35955) certification. 

## Preparation

As always I recommend going through the [Microsoft Learn: MS-102](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/ms-102/) course modules since it contains a lot of information's about Microsoft 365 which you can't obtain through other sites and videos. While going through the course I highly recommend practicing on your own Microsoft 365 environment as it will help you with understanding Microsoft 365 much better. 

Usually, after completing course materials I tend to go through my notes to create diagrams and relate the different information's together. I highly recommend everyone doing that as it will help you with better understanding different resources and features. However, majority of the things I learnt through the course materials were already in the different certifications which I completed so far therefore I spent time doing spaced repetitions. 

## Exam

At 3 of September, I was studying for MS-102 certification for few hours, and I randomly decided to book the exam and saw that an spot was available within 30 minutes so I quickly purchased it and joined the exam. Once I was in the exam I ended up panicking a bit since I saw I had to answer 68 questions within 140 minutes. I actually thought getting 68 questions was impossible in a Microsoft exam since multiple of sources told me it's only possible to get 40 to 60 questions. 

Anyway, the multiple of choice questions were fairly challenging but I managed to complete them without any issues and the case study was the most simplest part of the exam. After delivering in the exam, I saw a passing score of 820 / 1000.  I felt a huge relief after passing the [Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/husenjan/credentials/f6b075b311d35955) certification since I managed to complete all the goals I set up for myself for two years ago.
