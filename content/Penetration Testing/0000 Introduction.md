## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration Testing (Pentest) is a organized and authorized attack which the purpose is about finding security vulnerabilities in an organization and use these security vulnerabilities to gain access to the organization’s systems and then further elevate our privileges by compromising more systems.

The main goal of penetration testing is to find these vulnerabilities and have them patched before it affects the organization in a negative way. It’s also possible the organization may choose to accept the risk of a system vulnerability in [[0000 Introduction#Risk Management|Risk Management]].

## Penetration Testing Framework

![[9999 Penetration Testing Framework.svg]]

Penetration Testing Framework is a fantastic framework which goes through the different processes that are included in a penetration test. Here's a quick summary of the different stages:

| **Stages**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Information Gathering**            | This stage is about searching for information such as the systems, operating systems, and software’s the organization uses.                                    |
| **Vulnerability Assessment**         | This stage is about researching the vulnerabilities these systems, operating systems, and software’s can be vulnerable to.                                     |
| **Exploitation & Post Exploitation** | This stage is about reading through the exploit code and modifying it to our needs to exploit the service running on the system.                               |
| **Lateral Movement**                 | This stage is about elevating our access by compromising higher privileged accounts which allows us to access systems that contains confidential informations. |

Penetration Testers mostly spends their time in the information gathering and vulnerability assessment stages as these are key stages that allows us to compromise a environment and systems in that environment. And sites such as [CVEDetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/), [Packetstorm](https://packetstorm.news/), [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), [Vulners](https://vulners.com/), and [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search?execution=e2s1) are great in these stages.

## Risk Management

Risk Management is about analyzing the different security issues and risks to ensure the organization is protected. In some instances the organization may choose to accept certain risks as the system or software is business critical and in those instances, it’s highly recommended to have insurance on those systems and software’s incase it’s compromised in the future.

Risk Management also plays a critical role in a penetration test since the system could be vulnerable for multiple of vulnerabilities and executing these vulnerabilities against the system could potentially crash the system and affect the business negatively. An example is if the system is vulnerable for remote code execution and SQL injection, it’s always recommended to use SQL injection to minimize the risks of crashing the system.

## Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has a list over the top 10 most dangerous vulnerabilities for web applications. It’s a fantastic resource for understanding the different vulnerabilities for web applications and it also includes prevention methods for us to protect our web applications.

| **Number** | **Category**                                                                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                               |

It’s important to note that the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) could be different in the near future as new vulnerabilities and attack factors are discovered by security researchers. I highly recommend memorizing the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) as it’s a great thing to talk about during a interview as it can help you stand out from others.
