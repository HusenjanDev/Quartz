## About Me

Hey, I'm Husenjan!

I'm currently working on developing my skills in cyber security and programming as these things fascinates me. While developing my skills in these fields, I decided to create articles where I share my knowledge, experiences and solutions to help others.

If you're interested about my background, I'm a 24 years old who mostly spends his time learning new things in cyber security and programming to hopefully someday become a chief information security officer for an organization to protect their assets from threats.  I also currently hold multiple of certifications and I'm working towards obtaining more to further increase my knowledge!
