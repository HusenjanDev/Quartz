## About Project

The Security Asset Platform is a project I decided to build to increase my knowledge about software development and  cybersecurity. The idea is to build a application using C++ or Rust which sends changes occurring on the system to a backend API and use these datas to summarize logs from the servers. I will be open sourcing once the product is ready to be used in production to then I'll be blogging about the platform.

Today was a productive day for Security Asset Platform SaaS product. I implemented the sidebar navigation component and integrated authentication and authorization using Auth.JS. Here is a overview of the source code structure.

```text title="Application Structure"
├── app
│   ├── dashboard
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   ├── signin
│   │   └── page.tsx
│   └── api
│       └── auth
│           └── [...nextauth]
│               └── route.tsx
├── components
│   ├── app-sidebar.tsx
│   ├── signin-form.tsx
│   └── signout-button.tsx
├── auth.tsx
├── sAuth.tsx
└── middleware.tsx
```

The `auth.tsx` file is a configuration file which sets up the authentication and authorization. It's configured to use `Credentials` which means that we are responsible for handling the authentication and authorization.

```javascript title="auth.tsx"
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import Credentials from "next-auth/providers/credentials"

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
    pages: {
        signIn: "/signin"
    },
    session: { strategy: "jwt"},
    providers: [
        Credentials({
            credentials: {
            email: { label: "Username" },            
            password: { label: "Password", type: "password" },
            },
            async authorize(credentials) {
                if (!credentials?.email || !credentials?.password) {
                    return null;
                }

                if (credentials.email == "husenjan@hotmail.com" && credentials.password == "password") {
                    return {
                        id: "1",
                        name: "Husenjan",
                        email: "husenjan@husenjan.com"
                    }
                }

                return null;
            },
        }),
    ],
})
```

The `sAuth.tsx` file is a server action file which invokes the `signIn` function from `auth.tsx` to perform the authentication. The `signInAction` is exported and will be used with the `signin-form.tsx` component to perform the authentication. 

```javascript title="sAuth.tsx"
"use server";
import { signIn } from "@/auth";

export async function signInAction(credentials : { email : string, password : string}) {
    try {
        await signIn("credentials", {
            email: credentials.email,
            password: credentials.password,
            redirect: false
        });

        return { success : true };
    }
    catch (error) {
        return { success: false, error: "Wrong username or password."}
    }
}
```

The `signin-form.tsx` file is the component which displays the sign-in page and processes the sign-in request using the `signInAction` function from `sAuth.tsx` file. Once the authentication is successful the user is forwarded to `/` page.

```javascript title="signin-form.tsx"
"use client";
import { signInAction } from "@/sAuth";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "./ui/button";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
import { z } from "zod";
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod"
import { Form, FormControl, FormDescription, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel } from "./ui/form";
import { Input } from "./ui/input";
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "./ui/card";
import { toast } from "sonner";

export function SignInForm() {
    const router = useRouter();
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

    const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
        resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
        defaultValues : {
            email : "",
            password: ""
        }
    });

    async function onSubmit(values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) {
        setIsLoading(true);
        try {
            const result = await signInAction({
                email : values.email,
                password : values.password
            });

            if (result.success) {
                router.push("/");
                router.refresh();
            }
            else {
                toast.error("Please check your email and password and try again.");
            }
        } catch(error) {
            toast.error("Please check your email and password and try again.");
        }
        finally{
            setIsLoading(false)
        }
    }
    return (
        ...
    )
}
```

The `middleware.tsx` file is responsible for ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected pages and once the user is authenticated they can no longer access the sign in page.

```javascript title="middleware.tsx"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

export default auth((request) => {
    const { nextUrl } = request;

    const isAuthenticated = !!request.auth;

    const isProtectedRoute = ["/dashboard", "/"].includes(nextUrl.pathname);
    const isLoginRoute = ["/signin"].includes(nextUrl.pathname);

    if (isProtectedRoute && !isAuthenticated) {
        return Response.redirect(new URL("/signin", nextUrl));
    }

    if (isLoginRoute && isAuthenticated) {
        return Response.redirect(new URL("/", nextUrl));
    }
});

export const config = {
    matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)'],
};
```

The `middleware.tsx` file will deny access to `/` and `/dashboard` pages when the user is unauthenticated but allow access once they are authenticated. It's responsible to ensure that only authenticated users can access our protected pages.
