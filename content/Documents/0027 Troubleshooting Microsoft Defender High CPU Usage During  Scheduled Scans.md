## Introduction

I recently migrated all our devices into Microsoft Defender XDR and some of our users have been experiencing performance issues when the weekly scheduled scan is running on their system. In this article I decided to go through the configurations I applied to resolve the performance issue.

## AvgCPULoadFactor & Low CPU Priority

**What is `AvgCPULoadFactor` in Microsoft Defender XDR?** The `AvgCPULoadFactor` is a configuration that can be set through a Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy. It's used to specify the maximum precentage of the CPU usage for scanning engine but the `AvgCPULoadFactor` is not a hard limit but a guidance to the scanning engine. It's important to note that `AvgCPULoadFactor` is also known as `ScanAvgCPULoadFactor` in Windows.

**What is `Enable Low CPU Priority` in Microsoft Defender XDR?** The Low CPU Priority is also a configuration that can be set through Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy. It will ensure that Microsoft Defender scheduled scans are threated as low priority to ensure that it doesn't conflict with more important applications such as browsers, business applications, and etc...

We can configure `AvgCPULoadFactor` and `Enable Low CPU Priority` through the following steps.

1. Go to **Microsoft Intune -> Endpoint Security -> Antivirus**.

2. Create a new policy or configure the current policy.

3. Create a new policy and configure the `AvgCPULoadFactor` to `15{:number}`.

4. Enable the configuration **Enable Low CPU Priority** mode.

4. Save these configurations.

Once the Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy is applied to our machines we can use the following command to view the `AvgCPULoadFactor` and that value should be set to `15`. 

```powershell
Get-MpPreference | Select ScanAvgCPULoadFactor
```

If your users are experiencing performance issues after these configurations are applied to their machine, I recommend reading through the next section as it goes through fixing it.

## Performance Issues

When `ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled` and `DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans` options are set to `true` on Windows machine the `AvgCPULoadFactor` value set by our Microsoft Antivirus Policy is ignored which can lead to performance issues.

**What is `ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled` and `DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans`?** The `ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled` configuration ensures that Microsoft Defender XDR onlys cans during idle to prevent interuptions. And on the other side `DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans` ignores the CPU limits set by us to finish off scan quicker. You can view these configurations with the following command.

```powershell
Get-MpPreference | Select ScanAvgCPULoadFactor, DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans, ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled
```

The `ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled` and `DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans` options can be disabled by creating creating a configuration profile on Microsoft Intune.

1. Go to **Microsoft Intune -> Devices -> Configurations**.

2. Create a new policy.

3. Select Platform as **Windows 10 and later** and Profile type as **Setting Catalog** and click on Create.

4. Provide a **Name** and **Description**.

5. Search up **Scan Only If Idle Enabled** and select it.

6. Search up **Disable Cpu Throttle On Idle Scans** and select it.

7. Use the following configurations.

8. Assign and create the configuration profile.

Once the configuration profile is applied to the machines with High CPU Usage during scheduled scans these machines should no longer experience these performance issues from here on. 

## Conclusions

If your organization also uses scheduled scans with Microsoft Defender XDR it's recommended to use a low value on `AvgCPULoadFactor` and use the feature `Enable Low CPU Priority` as it will help with ensuring users can work while scheduled scan is running in the background. If your users are experiencing performance issues it's recommended to disable the option `ScanOnlyIfIdleEnabled` and  `DisableCpuThrottleOnIdleScans` options as these can interfere with the `AvgCPULoadFactor` set on Microsoft Defender Antivirus Policy.
