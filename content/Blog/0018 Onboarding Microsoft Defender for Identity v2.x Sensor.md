## Introduction

Microsoft Defender for Identity comes with the Microsoft Defender XDR suite. It uses the signals from Windows Active Directory to detect, investigate, and respond to cyberthreats.

It will help with detecting, investigating, and responding to attacks such as reconnaissance, lateral movements, brute-force attacks. Additionally, it will be able to use signals from Azure Active Directory, Windows Active Directory, and endpoints to reference affected users, devices, and services.
