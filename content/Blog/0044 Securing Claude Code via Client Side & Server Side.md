## Introduction

Claude comes with Claude Code, a product that allows developers to analyze and build applications through the terminal. It's also used by developers to automate repetitive tasks, which lets them focus on more important things such as optimization and architecture.

Claude Code can also read, write, and execute commands on the system, therefore it's important to secure Claude Code from reading, writing, and executing specific things.

## Claude Code Security

Inside the **Claude Code Organization Panel** there is a setting which allows us to restrict Claude Code from reading, writing, and executing specific things.

| Syntax      | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Bash`      | Used to allow or deny Claude Code from executing a command. |
| `Read`      | Used to allow or deny Claude Code from reading a file.      |
| `Write`     | Used to allow or deny Claude Code from writing to a file.   |

All these options allow us to secure Claude Code from executing specific commands and from reading critical files that contain API keys and much more information. Here is an example configuration for Claude Code:

```json title="managed-settings.json"
{
    "permissions": {
        "disableBypassPermissionsMode": "disable",
        "deny": [
            "Read(**/.env)",
            "Read(**/local-settings.json)",
            "Write(**/etc/passwd)",
            "Bash(sudo *)",
            "Bash(su *)",
            "Bash(curl *)",
            "Bash(git *)",
            "Bash(passwd *)",
            "Bash(chmod *)",
            "Bash(chown *)"
        ]
    }
}
```

Basically, the `managed-settings.json` file secures Claude Code by preventing it from reading files that contain API keys and by blocking the execution of specific commands. The `disableBypassPermissionsMode` option prevents users from bypassing the security configuration set in `managed-settings.json`.

## Securing through Server-Side

Claude allows us to secure Claude Code from the server-side through `managed-settings.json`, which is accessible via the following steps.

1. Click on **Organizational Settings**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 01.png]]

2. Go to **Claude Code**.
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 02.png]]

3. Click on **Manage** on **Manage Settings**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 03.png]]

I would recommend implementing strict access control for Claude Code, as it comes with the capability to read, write, and execute things on our end-users' systems. Here is a starter template that I would highly recommend using.

```json title="managed-settings.json"
{
    "permissions": {
        "disableBypassPermissionsMode": "disable",
        "deny": [
            "Read(**/.env)",
            "Read(**/local-settings.json)",
            "Read(**/id_rsa)",
            "Read(**/id_ecdsa)",
            "Read(**/id_ecdsa.pub)",
            "Read(**/id_rsa.pub)",
            "Write(**/etc/passwd)",
            "Write(C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\sam)",
            "Write(C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\security)",
            "Bash(sudo *)",
            "Bash(su *)",
            "Bash(curl *)",
            "Bash(git *)",
            "Bash(passwd *)",
            "Bash(chmod *)",
            "Bash(chown *)",
            "Bash(nmap *)",
            "Bash(ssh *)",
            "Bash(nc *)",
            "Bash(ncat *)"
        ]
    }
}
```

The server-side version of `managed-settings.json` will block requests whenever the user tries to read, write, or execute things mentioned in the `managed-settings.json` file. I'll now go through implementing these restrictions on the client-side, since it can help us enforce these configurations.

## Securing through Client-Side (Windows)

Claude also allows us to secure Claude Code from the client-side by adding the `managed-settings.json` file inside a registry key.

1. Go to **[Microsoft Intune](http://intune.microsoft.com)**

2. Go to **Devices -> Windows**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 04.png]]

3. Go to **Script and Remediation** under **Managed Devices** 
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 05.png]]

4. Click on **Create** on **Script & Remediations**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 06.png]]

5. Enter the **Name, Description, and Publisher**.
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 07.png]]

6. Use the **Detection Script** and **Remediation Script**.

    ```powershell title="Detection Script"
    # Claude Code Path & Desired Config
    $regPath = Test-Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode"
    $desiredConfig = '<PASTE YOUR DESIRED CONFIG>'

    if ($regPath -eq $true) {
        $currentConfig = (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Settings
        if ($currentConfig -ne $desiredConfig) {
            Exit 0
        }
    }
    else {
        Exit 1
    }
    ```
    ```powershell title="Remediation Script"
    # Claude Code Path & Desired Config
    $regPath = Test-Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode"
    $desiredConfig = '<PASTE DESIRED CONFIG>'

    if ($regPath -eq $true) {
        $currentConfig = (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Settings
        if ($currentConfig -ne $desiredConfig) {
            Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode" -Name 'Settings' -value $desiredConfig
        }
    }
    else {
        New-Item -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode" -Force | Out-Null
        New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\Software\Policies\ClaudeCode" -Name 'Settings' -Value '<PASTE DESIRED CONFIG>' | Out-Null
    }
    ```

7. Select the group or users to enable the enforcement of Claude Code.
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 09.png]]

8. Review the configuration and create the **Script & Remediation**.

## Securing through Client-Side (macOS)

Claude also allows us to secure Claude Code from the client-side on macOS devices by adding the `managed-settings.json` file inside a `.mobileconfig` file, which will be added into the macOS MDM enforcement directory.

1. Go to **Microsoft Intune**

2. Click on **Devices -> Configurations**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 11.png]]

3. Click on **Create -> New Policy**
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 12.png]]

4. Select **Platform, Profile Type, and Template Name**.
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 13.png]]

5. Enter the **Name and Description**.
    ![[0044 Securing Claude Code via Client Side & Server Side 14.png]]

6. Select Custom Configuration Profile Name as **Claude Code MDM Configuration** and Deployment Channel as **Device Control** and upload the .mobileconfig file.

## Conclusion

Anthropic, the company behind Claude, built a great tool that increases engineers' productivity. However, as Security Engineers, it's crucial for us to implement least privilege on these CLI tools, as they come with the capability to read, write, and execute on end-users' systems, in order to minimize the attack surface.

Fortunately for us, Anthropic allows us to enforce security settings through both the client-side and the server-side, which helps ensure that the attack surface is reduced. I would highly recommend setting up `managed-settings.json` for Claude Code to reduce the attack surface.
