## Information

Notepad++ infrastructure was recently compromised by state sponsored hackers which lead to some endpoints being compromised. The Notepad++ creators recommended everyone to update their Notepad++ to the latest version 8.91 which comes with improved security controls for updates. In this article, I'll go through creating an Notepad++ application profile in Microsoft Intune.

## Intunewin

The Notepad++ installer comes in `.exe` format which means we will need to generate an `.intunewin` file using Microsoft Content Prep Tool since that will allow us to setup the application profile in Microsoft Intune.

1. Download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
2. Download [Microsoft Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool)
3. Start **IntuneWinAppUtil** and enter the following details.

4. **IntuneWinAppUtil** will generate an `.intunewin` file inside of the output folder.

7. Select **Use a custom detection script** and use the following detection script.

    ```powershell 
    $notepad = Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Notepad++" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    if ($notepad.DisplayVersion -eq "8.9.1") {
        exit 0
    }
    else {
        exit 1
    }
    ```

9. Create the application profile.

## Conclusion

The Notepad++ installer comes with `.exe` format installer instead of `.msi` and that forces us to use [Microsoft Content Prep Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool) to create an `.intunewin` file. However, after the `.intunewin` file is generated all that needs to be done is setting up the profile using the custom PowerShell detection script.
