## Introduction

I recently received a complaint from a user in the organization that they are not able to communicate with the vendor through email. I investigated the issue and found out the issue was related to the vendor's DMARC configuration therefore I decided to whitelist the vendor temporarily. In this article I'll go through whitelisting a domain from DMARC on ProofPoint.

## Policy Routes

A polciy route allows us to create a group of a domans that should be routed differently from others. You can build a policy routes with the following steps:

1. Go to [ProofPoint Email Protection](https://admin.proofpoint.com)

2. Open **Mail Flow** and click on **Policy Routes**.

3. Click on **New Policy**.

4. Enter **Policy Route Name** and **Description**.

5. Click on **Add Condition**.

6. Use the following configuration on the condition.
    * **Policy Route Condition**: Envelope Sender 
    * **Operator**: Contains
    * **Text**: @husenjan.com

7. Click on **Enable this Policy Route** and **Save**.

I would recommend building a policy route for each domain that needs to be whitelisted since that allows us to do a quarterly audit and remove policy routes for vendors that resolved their issues.

## DMARC Exclusion

Usually, DMARC is configured to check all incoming emails. However, we can whitelist specific policy routes from being processed by DMARC.

1. Open **Email Protection** and click on **DMARC**.

2. Click on **General Settings**.

3. Click on **Edit**.

4. Scroll down to **Do not process on messages that belong to selected Policy Routes** and select the **Policy** and click **Save**.

Once the policy is applied it might take anywhere from 15 minutes to a hour before the client/vendor is able to send us emails without DMARC error occurring.

## Conclusion

DMARC is a great security mechanism to stop email spoofing from entering our environment. In some situation unfortunately a domain might need to be whitelisted because they are working on implementing a new mail system or there is a issue with their current mail system. Instead of letting that affect the business the domain can be temporarily whitelisted so it doesn't affect employees productivity.
