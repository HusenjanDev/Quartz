## Introduction

The [Decode Me Challenge](https://crackmes.one/crackme/69245c422d267f28f69b806e) from crackmes.one consists of understanding basic assembly code such as loops, character replacement, and encoding. I would highly recommend beginners who are interested in reverse engineering to try it out.

In this article I'll go through the technical details and solving the reverse engineering challenge.

## Application Information

* **Application Name:** `decodeme.exe`
* **SHA-256:** `0D900E451D636A0E915FFEB35FC96C68AB3D14D055A8EAFFA8FD1E6E40533136`

## Reversing

The `main` function has the password in plaintext `Pa100-322-1L@101` and the password address is assinged to `RCX` register which will be used with the `transformChar` function.

The `transformChar` functoin performs modifications to the plaintext password by looping through all the characters and replacing characters such as 1, 2, and 3 with special characters `_`, `>`, and `\`.

The `byteEncoder` function performs additional modification after the characters 1, 2, and 3 has replaced by looping through all the characters and converting them into hexadecimal code.

The `checker` function will remove characters such as `\` and `x` from the hexadecimal code string and from there it will check if the hexadecimal code string matches.

The user will need to replace the characters inside `Pa100-322-1L@101` with special characters that are shown in above and from there enter that password to the application. If the password is correct the application will print `Yes!` otherwise the application will print `No!` which means we failed the challenge.

## Solution

Instead of manually modifying the password, I wrote a Python script which will replace the characters such as `1`, `2`, and `3` with special characters  `_`, `>`, and `\`.

```python title="solve.py"
def solve(password : str):
    password = password.replace("0", "_")
    password = password.replace("1", ">")
    password = password.replace("2", "\\")

    print("Plaintext Password: " + password)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve("Pa100-322-1L@101")
```

```powershell title="Output"
PS C:\Users\Student> .\decodeme.exe
Write password: Pa>__-3\\->L@>_>
Yes!
Press any key to continue . . .
```

I would highly recommend solving the challenge using Python as it's commonly used to perform complex tasks quickly and efficiently which is important in reverse engineering.
## Conclusion

The [Decode Me Challenge](https://crackmes.one/crackme/69245c422d267f28f69b806e) was actually a really fun reverse engineering challenge which I would highly recommend beginners to try out as it will help them with understanding reverse engineering and assembly code concept more in-depth such as  loops, character replacement, and encoding.
